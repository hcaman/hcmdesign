                <p>Hi ! I am Hugo,
                    I am born in a northern city from Argentina, in Catamarca.
                    Since a little kid I liked the computing, I  always played a lot and  discovered all things that they had  to offer, I was always interested in analyzing and fixing computers problems.
                    As I was growing up, I started to enter the world of videogames, I played many hours and this woke up my curiosity. In addition, I have several friends that work in this fascinating field of the web development, so every time I was in contact with this.

                <p>Then I went to study in Cordoba, a city of the center, where I got my degree in Biochemistry, with which I then went to work in Buenos Aires in a Hospital this taught me analytical skills and how to tackle and solve a problem, later this job make me know Europe.
                <br>I never lost my interest on programming and therefore i decided to study Software Engineering on the university in my freetime. Nevertheless,  I could not complete it because I was working on the hospital, and the schedule was very tight. For this reason I changed my method of study and started learning by myself on Udemy, with lot of theoretical and practical classes of web programming. At the beginning with classes in spanish and later with classes in english because I found better and more updated classes.
